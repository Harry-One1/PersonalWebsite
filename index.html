    <p>In Terraria, as soon as you load up your world and character, you are dropped into a forest filled with trees, only starting with 3 items (unless playing in what is called a "journey" world). These items are the most simple in the game: A copper shortsword, a copper pickaxe, and a copper axe. You then proceed to survive in an unfimiliar world and defeat anything that stands in your path, eventually killing the god of that world.</p>

    <p> Space is an amazing phenomena, a vast expanse of nearly empty void populated by planets, stars, and other anomalies. Space is an impressive concept and holds the key to humanity becoming the most that it can. For instance, a dyson sphere is a theoretical concept in which we use, in some methods, millions or billions of tiny solar panels to surround the sun and give us infinite energy. This will be a crucial step in human advancement, but we are still nowhere close.</p>
