    <h2>Space, and Why You Should be Interested</h2>

    <h3>Awesome Events</h3>
    <p>Space is full of events and bodies that are commonly awe-inspiring, whether it be another planet with strange laws of nature and occurences (HD 189733b, the planet that rains molten glass) or things that we still have yet to understand.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>This is a table displaying interesting properties between different distant planets.</h3>
    <h3>Importance to our future</h3>
    <p>In order to survive as a species and civilization, we need to improve our way of life, which means that sooner or later we may have to move to another planet. The current top candidate is mars, as it is relatively close to the Earth, and with a little bit of terraforming can be a great place to live.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We will also need to do other things for ourselves to live comfortably. For example, the sources of energy we are currently using (fossil fuels) are bad for our planet, and the greenhouse gasses we are producing are weakening the ozon layer, the thing keeping us from dying from sun radiation. </p>
