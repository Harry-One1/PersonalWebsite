    <h1 class="terraria"> Terraria, the Best Game</h1>
    
    <h5 class="terraria"> Warning, opinion may differ between subjects</h5>
    
    <p class="terraria"> Terraria is a survival type game focused around a fantasy pixelated world. It is commonly regarded as as a two-dimensional version of the popular game "minecraft", as they have similar looking graphics, but that's just not true, even though the two are good friends. Terraris is so much more.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p class="terraria">In Terraria, as soon as you load up your world and character, you are dropped into a forest filled with trees, only starting with 3 items (unless playing in what is called a "journey" world). These items are the most simple in the game: A copper shortsword, a copper pickaxe, and a copper axe.</p>

    <h1 class="spore">Spore, the Evolution Experience</h1>
    
    <p class="spore">Spore is a game about evolution and how a species advances. When you start the game you are prompted to pick a random planet out of your virtual galaxy and name it, along with customizing the creature you will beging with.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p class="spore">After this descision, you and your creature eat to survive and evolve to grow unique parts that have many different uses. After you graduate from the cell stage you are given legs and allowed to muve to dry land, where you are able to kill or ally different species. Eventually your creature become so advanced that you are able to explore space and its many wonders. I enjoy this game because of the extreme replayability it has, going different routes through you creatures evolution or making it into whatever you want it to be.</p>
